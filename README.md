# Advanced NLP PDF to Bullet Point Summarizer ðŸ—Ÿ

The Advanced NLP PDF Summarizer is a cutting-edge tool designed to process and condense lengthy PDF documents into concise, informative summaries. Leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this application extracts key information, presenting it in an easily digestible format. This README provides an overview of the advanced NLP methodologies employed by our application and guidance on how to utilize its features effectively.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Utilizes PyPDF2 for efficient text extraction from PDF files, ensuring no content is overlooked during summarization.
- **Advanced Text Preprocessing**: Employs spaCy for sophisticated text preprocessing, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords, to refine the text for analysis.
- **Key Phrase Extraction**: Harnesses spaCy's NLP capabilities to identify and extract key phrases and named entities, pinpointing the most relevant information within the text.
- **Sentence Importance Scoring**: Implements a custom scoring algorithm based on the presence of key phrases and their centrality to the document's overall theme, highlighting sentences that encapsulate core ideas.
- **Dynamic Summarization**: Offers users the flexibility to adjust the extent of summarization, dynamically altering the summary's length based on user preference.

## How It Works

## Demo ðŸš€

### Text Extraction and Preprocessing

The application begins by extracting text from the uploaded PDF document. It then preprocesses this text using spaCy, performing tokenization to break down the text into individual words and sentences, and lemmatization to reduce words to their base or dictionary form. This step is crucial for reducing complexity and focusing on the semantic meaning of the text.

### Key Phrase Extraction

Key phrases and named entities are extracted to identify the most significant elements of the text. This process involves analyzing noun chunks and named entities, which often represent the main subjects and concepts discussed in the document.

### Sentence Scoring and Summarization

Each sentence is scored based on its content, particularly the inclusion of key phrases and its relevance to the overall document. The scoring algorithm prioritizes sentences that are central to the document's theme, ensuring that the summary captures the essence of the original text. Users can adjust the summarization scale, allowing for a customizable summary length that fits their specific needs.

## Getting Started
